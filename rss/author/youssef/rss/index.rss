<p>During the <strong>“The 3 Amigos”</strong> meeting, conversations take place between the business analyst, the developer and the tester and they elaborate the requirements together.</p>
<p>The output of this meeting is a set of <strong>acceptance scenarios</strong> corresponding to the requirements they have been discussing about.</p>
<p>These scenarios guide the developer and act as automated tests.<br>
These are very well suited to work in relation with <strong>Cucumber</strong> automation testing tool.</p>
<h2 id="belowisanexampleofaverysimpleacceptancescenario">Below is an example of a very simple acceptance scenario :</h2>
<pre><code>Story: Returns go to stock
As a store owner
In order to keep track of stock
I want to add items back to stock when they're returned.


Scenario 1: Refunded items should be returned to stock
Given that a customer previously bought a black sweater from me
And I have three black sweaters in stock.
When he returns the black sweater for a refund
Then I should have four black sweaters in stock.


Scenario 2: Replaced items should be returned to stock
Given that a customer previously bought a blue garment from me
And I have two blue garments in stock
And three black garments in stock.
When he returns the blue garment for a replacement in black
Then I should have three blue garments in stock
And two black garments in stock.
